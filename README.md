# movie-list

The project is about to work with the [Trakt.tv API](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/#) and give the users two opportunities.

1. When the user starts the app, he will see a list with the **10 most popular movies** and by scrolling down a new request will be executed to show the next ten movies.
2. The User can switch via Tabs between showing the 10 most popular movies and **searching** movies. The search will be executed automatically while typing the searchterm. Also it should be scrollable via pagination (landscape mode).
